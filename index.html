                        <img class = "fright"  alt="EX08" src="images/EX08.png" width="77" height="129" /><p><b>Automan CV96 - SSL configuration</b> is the base unit (CV96) loaded with one or more I/O-cards (EX08) and the optional set of 8 motor faders (MF08). The CV96 can host up to 12 cards (supporting up to 96 channels). Automan EX08 talks to 1 bank (8 channels) of the SSL console. Automan EX08 is a card designed for the SSL 4/6/8000 series. With 8 analog CV in & out plus a couple of switch and LED lines it's plug and play with the original computer interface.</p>

                <p><img class = "fleft"  alt="MF08" src="images/MF08.png" width="150" height="108" /><b>Automan MF08</b> is a kit of 8 motor faders that is compatible with the SSL VCA fader (same size and connectors). Automan MF08 is best placed where the VCA group faders are. Here they double as manual VCA groups faders and a control surface for the rest of your console. Automan MF08 shows you all information you need. Channel number, exact fader position (<0.1dB steps) , current offset to null in 0.1 dB accuracy and auto status (manual, auto, touch and read). Automan MF08 adds soft recordable mute where the SSL channel acts as hard mute. Automan EX08 will automatically find the installed MF08:s. Super easy installation.</p>
        <p><b>Automan TR96</b> is a Total Recall-card planned to be released Q2 2015. Together with the SW96TR Software it adds full Total Recall support to the system.</p>
